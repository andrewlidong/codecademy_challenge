// justCoolStuff()
//
// Write a function justCoolStuff() that takes in two arrays of strings, and, using the built-in .filter() method, returns an array with the items that are present in both arrays.
//
// let arr1 = ['this', 'not this', 'nor this"];
// let arr1 = ['thing 1', 'thing 2', 'this'];
//
// justCoolStuff(arr1, arr2); // Should return ['this']
// You can test your function when you're ready by passing in the myStuff and coolStuff arrays or by making arrays of your own.

console.log("9. Just Cool Stuff");
